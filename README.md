# poc-challenge-fmt
Challenge format string by Osanda https://osandamalith.com/2018/02/01/exploiting-format-strings-in-windows/ (Creator of the challenge)

Note.: The return address 0x0014f720 in my lab windows 10 32 bit the address contains 0x20 which is a bad, i haven't figured out a solution, other than that the poc is working fine.
